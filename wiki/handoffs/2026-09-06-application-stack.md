# Application Stack Integration

The user redirected work from backend optimization to the enterprise application stack, with
Spring Boot / C# web application capabilities as the reference. Preserve LSP work and leave it
outside this assignment. Existing concurrent compiler refactors and LSP changes remain owned
by their authors. The broad application objective remains incomplete.

Language Architect → STD Implementer. Own Std.App.Database typed query/transaction helpers and
Std.Http.Server.Reply typed HTML/JSON responses, mirrors and navigation. No tests, builds, reviews
or measurements, per user direction. Commit only this scope directly to dev.

Deliver queryAll/queryOne/queryOptional with structured query-versus-mapping errors; expose the
existing driver transaction boundary from the application resource. Provide page/view/jsonValue
response helpers through the existing HTTP serialization path.

Exact next action: connect these APIs in a runnable database-backed HTML and JSON application
example with explicit configuration, routes and startup/shutdown ordering.
